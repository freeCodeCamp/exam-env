# Exam Environment

## Development

https://v2.tauri.app/start/prerequisites/

This repo uses `pnpm`.

### Development Server

```bash
cargo tauri dev
```

### Adding Plugins

```bash
cargo tauri add <plugin-name>
```

### Miscellaneous

Generating TypeScript types from Rust types to keep them in sync:

```bash
cargo test
```

---

More info you will probably find very useful:

```bash
cargo tauri --help
```

### Errors

The main types of error:

1. Unrecoverable
2. Blocking
3. Non-blocking

During an exam, errors are treated with the utmost care. On other pages/events, errors are less high-profile.

Unrecoverable errors emit events to Sentry, and either an error page is shown to the Camper, or the app crashes (sometimes this is unavoidable).

Blocking errors prevent further access to the app until the error is resolved.

Non-blocking errors display an inline message about the failure to the Camper. It is up to the user to retry the action.

#### During an Exam

##### Unrecoverable Errors

**Example: API returns 500 for generated exam request**

After retrying request 3 times, the error page is shown. An event is emitted to Sentry.

##### Blocking Errors

The exam attempt is continued, but no more question submissions may be made until the error is resolved.

**Example: Connection to API is offline**

A modal appears telling Camper to reconnect and rety request. Once the request is able to go through, the modal disappears.

Likely causes:

- Device loses internet connection

**Example: Camera is inaccessible**

A modal appears requesting access be reinstated.

Likely causes:

- App permissions to media device revoked
  - Manually done by Camper
  - Manually done by 3rd party
    - 3rd party takes priority access to camera. E.g. Google Meet
- Device is disconnected from computer
  - Manually done by Camper
  - Malfunction

**Example: OS secret storage loses access to authorization token**

After retrying to get the key from the OS keystore, a modal appears requesting the token be set again.

Likely causes:

- App permissions to keystore revoked
  - Manually done by Camper
  - Manually done by 3rd party
- Deletion of token from keystore
  - Manually done by Camper
  - Manually done by 3rd party
    - Would require Camper to give the 3rd party permission to access this keystore

##### Non-Blocking Errors

**Example: API is unable to process screenshots**

The app continues sending requests, and the Camper is oblivious to issue. This is entirely handled/logged by the API.

#### Elsewhere

##### Unrecoverable Errors

##### Blocking Errors

##### Non-Blocking Errors

## Build

### Updater (DISABLED)

Requires updater signing keys for the update artifacts:

```bash
export TAURI_SIGNING_PRIVATE_KEY="Path or content of your private key"
# optionally also add a password
export TAURI_SIGNING_PRIVATE_KEY_PASSWORD=""
```

Creating the key is a **ONE TIME** operation:

```bash
cargo tauri signer generate -w ./.tauri/exam-env.key
```

### Workflow

A manual run of the `publish` action can build and cut the release of the app. The `version` field in the `package.json` and `src-tauri/tauri.conf.json` files should be updated.

This is often best done in its own PR:

```bash
# Create patch, minor, major branch
git checkout -b release_<kind>
# Update version in package.json and src-tauri/tauri.conf.json
# Commit with message
git commit -m "release(<version>): <info>"
# Tag commit
git tag -a <version> -m "<info>"
# Push to remote
git push origin release_<kind>
# Merge PR, start GH Action
```

### Local

```bash
cargo tauri build --config src-tauri/tauri.dev.conf.json
# OR, build a debug build
cargo tauri build --debug
```

The `tauri.conf.dev.json` config does not sign the bundle, and does not create updater artifacts. Also, it disables the `contentProtected` feature so the app can be screenshotted.

### Windows

```bash
.\scripts\WindowsEnv.ps1 -Command "cargo tauri build --config src-tauri/tauri.microsoftstore.conf.json --bundles msi,updater --target x86_64-pc-windows-msvc"
```
